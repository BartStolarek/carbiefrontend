Privacy Policy — Carbie
Last updated: [Insert Date]

Carbie respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

1. What Carbie Does
Carbie lets you enter a text description or upload an image of food or drinks. Your request is sent securely to our servers, where we process it using Claude AI to estimate carbohydrate content, peak blood glucose time, and likely ingredients. Results are sent back to your device in the app.

2. Information We Collect
Information you provide
Account details: Email and password (your password is securely encrypted and never stored in plain text).

Prompts: Text descriptions and, if you choose, images you submit. Images are processed but never stored.

Optional info (if you choose to provide it): Age, sex, or general location — stored only on your device to help improve portion size estimates.

Information we store
Claude AI responses and the prompts you send (anonymised so they can’t be linked back to you) for future app improvements and feature development.

Subscription status (whether your account is active or not). No payment details are stored by us.

Information from support requests
If you email us or use our website contact form, we collect your email address and message so we can respond. These messages stay in our inbox.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:

Provide the main Carbie service.

Improve the app and develop new features.

Respond to support requests.

Maintain your subscription status.

We never sell your personal information.

4. How We Share Your Information
We only share information when necessary to run the service:

With Claude AI, to process your request and generate results.

With Google Play Store and RevenueCat, to manage subscriptions.
These providers have their own privacy policies.

We do not share your personal data with advertisers.

5. Data Security
All data sent between your device and our servers is encrypted with HTTPS/TLS.

Access to your account requires a secure bearer token.

Passwords are encrypted before storage.

6. Data Retention
Images are never stored — they are processed in real time and then discarded.

Claude responses and prompts are stored in anonymised form for as long as needed for app improvements.

Support emails are kept in our inbox unless you request deletion.

Optional demographic data is only stored locally on your device and is never sent to us unless you include it in a request.

7. Your Choices
Account deletion: You can delete your account permanently via our website. This will erase your account data and subscription status but anonymised prompt history may be kept for analysis.

Contacting us: You can reach us via the website contact form or email for questions about your data.

8. International Users
Our servers are located in [insert country — your home server location]. If you use Carbie from another country, your information will be transferred and processed here.

9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we’ll notify you in the app or on our website.
